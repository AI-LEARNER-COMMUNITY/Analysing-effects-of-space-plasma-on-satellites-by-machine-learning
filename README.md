# Analysing-effects-of-space-plasma-on-satellites-by-machine-learning
The effects of space plasma on satellites can include surface charging, degradation of solar panels, and impacts on communication systems.This python project notebook simulates the effect of space plasma by introducing variations in surface charging and solar panel degradation over time.
